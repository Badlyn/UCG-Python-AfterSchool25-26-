Here are th programs I made in python:
MyFirstReallyAwesomeProgram is just 4 print messages that introduces a little bit about myself.
var is the same as MyFirstReallyAwesomeProgram but now I'm calling variables into messages.
method is essentially the same thing as var except now its setting perameters and making sure variables are how they should be.
calc is a calculator that solves all basic math all at once!
bill splitter is another calculator that splits the bill depending on the variables inputed by the user
traffic is code that determines if you're old enough to drive depending on the input the user puts in.
looping is pattern that goes up by 5
MaxNum is code that picks from a line of random thats and determines which number is the highest value.
Countdown counts down from a user-given number to 1.
NameWhile will tell the user their name depending on the name they input. It tells them if there's nothing if there's nothing in the input.
Login is a program that ends only if the user put in the right password.
SecretNum is a program that has a set number and the user tries to guess what that secret number is. The program gives them hints if their guess was either too high or too low.
numrev is a program that reverses a number depending on what the user inputs. can kind of work with letters to.
StringReverseIns is a program that puts any word the user inputs in proper reverse order.
pattern creates a pattern that adds more numbers depedning on what the user inputed. For an example "2" would be "22" and "5" would be "55555" and it would continue if the user inputed something like "100" until it stopped at that specifc point.
funcation is essentially a calculator that solves all basic math all at once but now uses functions! The functions make the code look cleaner and more concise.
Multiples was going to be looping but I forgot to change the name and now its just an empty coffin

This is everything I did so far this year!
